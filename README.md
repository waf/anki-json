This repository builds an APKG file (for importing into Anki/AnkiDroid) from the JSON file `resources/cards.sealang.json`.
It's built around thai/english language flashcards, but it shouldn't be too hard to repurpose it for other JSON files.

# Download

If you just want the Thai flashcards generated by this library, download `dist/thai.apkg`.

# Installation

If you want to generate your own Anki flash card deck (.apkg), clone this repo and modify the python script as required.
On Mac OS, install the Anki app to get the required python libraries:

```sh
$ brew cask install anki
```

Modify the anki-import.py script. The script reads a json file that contains an array of the objects:

```json
{
    "rank":"1",
    "source":"AUA Reader AUA Chapter 01",
    "thai": "ดี",
    "english":"To be good"
}
```

This object

## anki-import
Converts a json file to an APKG file, with support for nested decks.

```sh
# generate cards from a source json file
$ ./anki-import.py resources/cards.sealang.json
```

## split-json
A helper script for splitting large JSON files into smaller JSON files.

```sh
# list all sources
$ ./split-json.py list

# split source
$ ./split-json.py split $source $outfile

# example
$ ./split-json.py split SEAlang SEAlang.json
```
