This repository builds a thai.apkg file (for importing into Anki/AnkiDroid) from the JSON file `resources/cards.sealang.json`.
It's built around thai/english language flashcards, but it shouldn't be too hard to repurpose it for other JSON files.

# Download

If you just want the Thai flashcards generated by this library, download `dist/thai.apkg`.

# Installation

If you want to generate your own Anki flash card deck (.apkg), clone this repo and modify the python script as required.

# Modification

Modify the json-to-anki.py script. The script reads a json file that contains an array of the objects:

```json
{
    "rank":"1",
    "source":"AUA Reader AUA Chapter 01",
    "thai": "ดี",
    "english":"good"
}
```

If you import this file, it would not have any nested decks in the resulting Anki deck
(because it's a flat array of cards). If you want categories (in this case, a category for each chapter),
you would design a source map like this:

```json
{
    "AUA Reader AUA Chapter 01": {
        "source": "AUA Lessons::Chapter 01"
    },
    "AUA Reader AUA Chapter 02": {
        "source": "AUA Lessons::Chapter 02"
    }
}
```

## json-to-anki.py
Converts a json file to an APKG file, with support for nested decks.

```sh
# generate cards from a source json file
$ ./json-to-anki.py
```

## split-json
A helper script for splitting large JSON files into smaller JSON files.

```sh
# list all sources
$ ./split-json.py list

# split source
$ ./split-json.py split $source $outfile

# example
$ ./split-json.py split SEAlang SEAlang.json
```

# SEALang deck

The SEALang deck generated from the cards.sealang.json file contains the following categories ("nested decks"):

- AUA Lessons
     - Chapter 01
     - ...
